<h1>About the assigment</h1>

The purpose of this assignment was to analyse the Android platform components, their uses, and develop an Android application that can interact with web service APIs and built in device sensors. There was no predetermined purpose for the application, therefore we were free to develop our own ideas. The resulting application was developed in Android Studio and it helps to keep track of daily finances. The application is called "Daily Finance".
